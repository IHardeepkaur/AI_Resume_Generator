# AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator (Context-Aware)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Generative AI application that creates
a professional resume summary and a personalized cover letter based on
user input such as job role, skills, and experience level.

Due to API quota limitations, a mock AI logic is used for demonstration,
while the project structure supports real AI integration.
